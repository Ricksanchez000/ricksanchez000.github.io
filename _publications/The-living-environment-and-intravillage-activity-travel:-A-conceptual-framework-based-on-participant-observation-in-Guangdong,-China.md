excerpt: 'We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the complex nature of the correlation between the living environment and intravillage activity-travel. Based on participant observations of 146 villages (2317 rural residents) in Guangdong, China, we find that the rural built environment is predominantly organised by the gemeinschaft cultural environment in which people locate their homes near ancestral halls to maintain the bonds with those who are identified as the Us and to separate themselves from the Other. Together with the impact of the social environment which brings about a dispersed distribution of household farmlands, the phenomenon of home-farmland separation is pervasive. Several transport-related issues are engendered from the rural living environment: (a) distorted time-space for other activities that improve rural residents’ quality of life; (b) land abandonment due to unwillingness to travel …'

We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the complex nature of the correlation between the living environment and intravillage activity-travel. Based on participant observations of 146 villages (2317 rural residents) in Guangdong, China, we find that the rural built environment is predominantly organised by the gemeinschaft cultural environment in which people locate their homes near ancestral halls to maintain the bonds with those who are identified as the Us and to separate themselves from the Other. Together with the impact of the social environment which brings about a dispersed distribution of household farmlands, the phenomenon of home-farmland separation is pervasive. Several transport-related issues are engendered from the rural living environment: (a) distorted time-space for other activities that improve rural residents’ quality of life; (b) land abandonment due to unwillingness to travel; and (c) extreme social exclusivity in relation to the Other.
